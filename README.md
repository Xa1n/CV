I'm a Software Engineer who used to be a biosocial anthropologist, until I became frustrated with always diagnosing the problems with the world. I want to do something that changed it. 

For the last seven years I've studied a variety of disciplines, and amid my studies I've watched the world advance past its potential to  improve the conditions of humanity & our planet. I feel like I inevitably found tech as an answer to this issue. To me, software represents a digital, borderless world where engineers like myself can extend real, tangible help around the world.

From March 2019, I enrolled in Makers Academy, a highly selective software development bootcamp. Through a project-based, self-directed curriculum, I have come to appreciate just how effective collaboration in a team can be. I've been fortunate enough to greatly advance existing skills such as research, as well as pick up brand new ones like creating program structures and using an AGILE process in a team. The course so far has only furthered my passion to work in an environment full of challenges that are best tackled in a supportive team with mutual interests in growth.

**Tech skills** : Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Xcode, PostgreSQL, Python, Flask, TDD, BDD

## PROJECTS:

Project title  | Description                                      | Project Timeframe | Technologies | Testing
------------- | ------------------------------    | ------------- |------------- |---------
[Breathe](https://github.com/callum-marshall/Breathe)| Concerned about the worsening levels of pollution in London, my team created an iPhone app that allows a user to see real-time pollution data around London on a tactile map. In two weeks, our team of four used an effective AGILE process to learn Swift and Xcode and various dependencies, along with TDD/BDD to drive the app's development. In this project, I led a number of stand-ups and retrospectives each day to help with daily progress. | 10 days (Team of Four) | Swift , Xcode, Mapbox, SwiftyJSON, Alamofire | Travis, SwiftLint, XCTest
[Acebook](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/acebook-Isambard):  Deployed at:  [hhttps://acebook-isambard.herokuapp.com/](https://acebook-isambard.herokuapp.com/) | A clone of Facebook. In two weeks we learned Ruby on Rails and Continuous Integration & Development. We followed an AGILE process to deliver an MVP to our clients. I led a number of tasks in controller logic and deployment and helped test drive the website before production. I used my experience in research and editing to quickly and effectively debug and get my team out of sticking points across the project. | 9 days (Team of Six) | Ruby , Rails,  PostgreSQL | Travis, Rspec, Capybara
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/tsankhalpara/MakersBnB) | A clone of AirBnB. In four days, our team learned a new tech stack including Express.JS, Jasmine and Cypress for TDD, and PostgreSQL. As our first team engineering project, we experimented with pairing and mobbing in order to find what suited us best. Together we learned how to work in an AGILE way and make use of git branching.| 4 days (Team of Four) | Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL | Jasmine, Cypress
[Machine Learning](https://github.com/Xa1n/jupyter) | A Machine Learning tutorial developed by Kaggle.com. Having a passion for Machine Learning and AI, I started this project to teach myself the basics. This project attempts to train a model with data from the famous Titanic sinking to predict which categories of people were more likely to survive. In addition to the tutorial, I used various online courses (Coursera, Codecademy) to supplement my learning. | 2 weeks | Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Sci-Kit Learn | Test datasets

## SKILLS
### Versatility
Both my academic career and work experience have given me the opportunity to learn a host of skills that I have picked up quickly. Despite coming from a legal background, I have had the chance to learn other social as well as biological disciplines. I have also been invited to write historical pieces for a renowned journal, and have written my own novel that secured me a mentorship. I set up my own media website, and edited scripts for a production company. Initially I did not have the required experience for these roles, but I worked hard to learn and apply them as professionally as possible.

### Teamwork
During my time at Gulf Production, I acted as co-ordinator for a nationwide project. I was able to easily find and contact specialists in a wide range of fields to participate in educational interviews for viewers in Kuwait. I helped ensure everything ran on time, and that the directors and film crew were given the necessary information for each day. The team commended me on how smoothly the 2-week project ran despite some cancellations from experts, who I was able to replace for the next day. By communicating with the film crew and drivers effectively, we were able to complete the work in the given slots. My perserverance and composure under these stressful situations led the filming to be completed on time and the directors to be happy with the material they got.

### Curiosity
No matter where I am, I'm always learning. If there's something I don't know, I'll read about it until I understand it and can teach it to a child. As part of my Masters, I was able to study a separate field as part of a new multi-disciplinary initiative. I chose biology and studied neuroscience and genetics in order to write my thesis on the pseudo-biological ethnographies of indigenous Amazonians in the 20th century. I'm never satisfied with what I know, so even with topics I am comfortable with explaining, I dedicate several hours in the week to learning and re-learning them.
